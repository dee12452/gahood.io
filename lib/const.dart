I started my journey with a love for modding computer games, 
which evolved into a passion for software engineering. My 
experience spans a wide range, from designing complex UI for 
B2C Android applications to architecting scalable backend systems 
for large B2B products. I enjoy learning about great programming 
techniques and new technologies, and thrive in challenging and 
cooperative situations. With my outstanding coding ability, I hope 
to make a big difference in the business world.
